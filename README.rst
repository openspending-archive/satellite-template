OpenSpending Satellite Site Template
====================================

This repo is a template that can be used to easily create custom budget and spending 
visualization sites using data from `OpenSpending`_.

An example of the kind of site that you can create (very quickly) using this
template is `Where Does My Money Go?`_.

What is in this repository?
---------------------------

Satellite sites runs as simple static websites built out of plain HTML and JS
and  pulling data from `OpenSpending`_. All data is stored in the OpenSpending
platform and the visualizations and search are driven directly from its `API`_. 

.. _`OpenSpending`: http://openspending.org
.. _`API`: http://openspending.org/help/api.html

The repository contains a basic layout for the site, based on Twitter's `Bootstrap 2`_
CSS framework, and a skeleton site based on Jekyll, a simple generator tool for static
web sites. The key component is code samples for embedding most of the widgets that are
currently available for OpenSpending: 

.. _`Bootstrap 2`: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/

* ``bubbletree.html`` holds the classic `BubbleTree <https://github.com/okfn/bubbletree>`_ 
  diagram, which can be used to easily break down a multi-level hierarchy of 
  classifications (such as the COFOG codes in the UK budget).
* ``bubbletree-map.html`` combines the BubbleTree and a simple vector map of the UK. This 
  would be more work to adapt for a custom site, but the beautiful view may well be worth
  the effort.
* ``dailybread.html`` contains the Daily Bread custom tax viewer, which breaks down
  government expenditure over the approximate tax contribution of the visitor.
* ``browser.html`` is a search interface for transactional spending information, used 
  for the UK's departmental spend in this example. This is useful for datasets which are 
  too unstructured for proper aggregation but contain interesting information at a
  detailed level.


How do I make a budget site for my own country/region?
------------------------------------------------------

If you want to set up a budget monitoring site for your own country, you first need
to acquire some budgetary or spending data and `load it into OpenSpending`_ using the 
site's web interface. Once the data is loaded, you can `fork this repository`_ and 
change the titles, styles and arrangement to meet your individual needs. Finally,
you can either host the site yourself, or let `GitHub Pages`_ do it.

.. _`GitHub Pages`: http://pages.github.com/


How do I build the site?
------------------------

The pages in this repository are built to their final form by combining them with
the template in ``_layouts/default.html`` using `Jekyll`_, a Ruby-based static site 
generator. To build the site, you first need to `install Jekyll` (works on either
Mac OS X or Linux)::

  sudo gem install jekyll

A good tutorial for Windows is available `here`_.

After that, you can simply build the site or even run a local web server by running
this command from the repository root directory::

  jekyll --server --auto

If you cannot install jekyll for some reason, you can still experiment with the site
by deploying its contents after each change.

The easiest way to deploy the site is via GitHub pages. To use them, simply adapt the
``CNAME`` file in the root of the repository and push to the ``gh-pages`` branch. All
pages will be automatically built and deployed.

What customizations should I make if I set up my own site?
----------------------------------------------------------

In order to create a new, white-label site, there are a number of easy tweaks you can
make. 

* Edit the configuration file in ``_config.yml`` to set the overall site title and 
  some basic parameters, such as the OpenSpending installation to be used. Further 
  configuration options, mostly regarding page generation, are available for Jekyll.
* The JavaScript initializations for each of the widgets need to be customized; in 
  particular the dataset name needs to be set and an appropriate set of break down
  dimensions needs to be set for the BubbleTree and DailyBread. The most common configurations for these widgets can be done in ``_config.yml``
* Adapt the style sheet in ``css/style.css`` to use your own theming; in particular 
  fonts and colorization.
* Replace ``img/logo.png`` to set a custom logo.
* Edit the basic HTML structure of the project in ``_layouts/default.html`` to extend
  or shorten the menu and any other page elements.

calls to OpenSpending, take a few minutes to read up on the technical background:

Where do I find help?
---------------------

This repository is a community-supported resource and there are several places
where you can call on the community to help you customize it for your needs:

* `OpenSpending Developers List <http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/openspending-dev>`_
* `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/openspending/satellite-template/issues>`_ at 
  GitHub (please report any problems here.
* Also join us on the ``#openspending`` channel on the FreeNode IRC network

The OpenSpending team can also offer tailored support to build a customized site
about government finance, to help you create your own visualizations or to answer
specific questions related to budgetary or spending data.

This additional level of support comes with service level agreements and is ideal for
projects working to a tight deadline, those looking for new-types of visualisation,
high-stake or long term projects. If you are interested in finding out more about our
availability and what we can offer please get in touch with the OpenSpending project
